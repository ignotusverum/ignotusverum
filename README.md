**Hi, I'm Vlad Z.**

Right now I’m working at Resy(AMEX) as a Senior Software Engineer, building mobile games at the spare time and trying to learn how to play chess.

I am best known for creating large-scale mobile applications that is featured in Apple’s App store and used by millions of people. I love leading by example and write code, mainly to play with new technologies and show it to my peers.
