**Hi, I'm Vlad**

My name is Vlad, and my leadership in developing a large-scale mobile application, which gained recognition in Appleâ€™s App Store and reached millions of users, defines my professional journey. My passion lies in guiding teams by setting a strong example, especially in the realms of coding and innovation. I thrive on exploring emerging technologies and enjoy the role of a mentor, sharing my insights and discoveries with my colleagues to inspire collective growth and creativity.
